# Experiences:
## Olin Ground Robotic Autonomous Vehicle Lab Research

## Summer 2018 GE Internship
I applied to this internship to learn about what career opportunities were available in a mechanical engineering environment and ended up learning a lot about what work is like in the industry. My assignment was on a Product Support Team for CT7/T700 (link) helicopter engines where I helped develop digital tools for the team.
#### Projects:
- Rotorcraft Operations Center (link)
- Graphing GUI

# Classes at Olin:
## Software Design (1st Year, 2nd Semester)
This class covered foundational python topics while providing flexibility in the projects we wanted to create.
#### Projects:
- Webcam-Based Fruit Ninja Game: Python-based, uses OpenCV to track hands for intuitive and immersive controls.
- ROS Robot Navigation: Created a ROS package to navigate a TurtleBot through a map

## Quantitative Engineering Analysis I (1st Year, 2nd Semester)
This class is an 8-credit experimental project-based class combining Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Physics together in one class.
#### Projects:
- Boat: Designed and fabricated a boat to meet certain design requirements
- Facial Recognition: Applied linear algebra concepts to write facial recognition software in MatLab.
- Robots: Applied multivariable calculus concepts to do path planning, gradient ascent, and obstacle avoidance with NEATO robots (link)
