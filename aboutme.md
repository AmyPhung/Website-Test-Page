Iâ€™ve wanted to be an engineer since I was in 4th grade. It all started when I saw a model of the mars rover Opportunity at NASA back in 2008, and I've been intrigued by robots ever since. As a kid, I played with LEGOS and took extra math classes over the summer, which continued to build up my interests. One of my favorite memories from when I was a child was when I attended a LEGO robotics camp and combined multiple robotics kits to make things I couldn't with one set alone (link)

When I got a bit older, I looking for a challenge in school and was inspired by some articles on the internet to skip eighth grade. Despite the school's initial doubt and hesitation, they eventually helped me skip and were incredibly supportive of my decision, which became an integral part of building my confidence going into highschool.

In highschool, I participated in a bunch of different activities including debate, tennis, STEM club, and various school honor societies, but in the end the only thing that really stuck was robotics. I was on FIRST Robotics Competition Team 691 (link), and I really attribute a lot of where I am today because of that experience. I really enjoyed my experience with FIRST and would recommend the program to anyone looking for a good learning experience.

Now, I'm a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering. I absolutely love this school...the projects are amazing, the campus is beautiful, but the best thing about this school is how friendly and dedicated everyone is, from the professors to the students to the dining hall staff. I can't imagine going to school anywhere else. It's only been a year but I already have an internship and lots of project experience under my belt, and I'm sure there's plenty of more amazing opportunities to come!

I can't wait to see what the future will hold!
