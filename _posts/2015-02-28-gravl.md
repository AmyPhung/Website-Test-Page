The objective of this research group changes from semester to semester, so the objectives and outcomes of each semester are listed individually

Fall 2018:
This semester, our objective is to finish up last semester's project, then start to work on making the platform more robust


Spring 2018:
During this semester, our objective was to create an autonomous robot to do terraforming. Robotics lab projects during this semester were mars-themed, and so the concept behind our project was to create a vehicle that could scan the landscape in front of it and determine the necessary height of the box blade to level it.

Fall 2017:
During this semester, our objective was to create a package delivery system with a combination of an autonomous drone and an autonomous tractor. At the conclusion of this semester, we were able to get the independent subsystems in order to achieve this goal working, but did not combine the subsystems into one project.
